This are my settings I tend to pull into my work environments.
Most importantly, vim settings to get me productive. :-)

Setup when the home is not empty:
git init .
git remote add origin https://github.com/maettu/Settings.git
git pull origin master

Homedir is empty, simply:
git clone https://github.com/maettu/Settings.git .
